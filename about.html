            <p class="apresentacao_paragrafo">Well, as I already mentioned, my name is Andrei Rech, and I'm a 19yo <span>Brazilian software engineering student</span> at PUCRS. I thoroughly enjoy learning about different programming languages and I'am currently familiar with <strong class="marcacao">Java, CSS, HTML</strong> and knowing a little of <strong class="marcacao">JavaScript and Python</strong>. Additionally, I'm already fluent in <strong class="marcacao">Portuguese and English.</strong> I'm on a journey to discover and become fluent in <strong class="marcacao">Japanese</strong>, and in the near future, I plan to learn <strong class="marcacao">Spanish and Italian.</strong> </p>

            <p class="apresentacao_paragrafo">In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing games, listening to music, hanging out with friends and family, and playing with my dogs. In the future, I plan to become an AI specialist. Achieving this goal requires a lot of time and effort, but I'm working hard to reach it. Lastly, I consider myself a gentle, calm, and patient person who appreciates a peaceful environment and being surrounded by nice people.</p>

            <p class="apresentacao_paragrafo">If you liked what you read and want to know more, you can access my social media (home page) to learn even more! Thanks, and see you!</p>
