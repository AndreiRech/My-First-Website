# My-First-Website
This is my first application with HTML and CSS so I don't know really well what I'm doing. So, yeah.

Now that I'm seeing this again after just a couple of weeks, it's really simple (not to say...) but I want to keep it this way because I'll be able to see my progress on my next personal website (which I'll do someday, but not soon).
